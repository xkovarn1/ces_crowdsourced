# A Comprehensive Framework for Automated Identification of Cultural Ecosystem Services

Welcome to the repository for our framework focused on the **automated identification of Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES)** through user-generated content.

## Overview

This repository contains the code used to perform **web scraping on the Google Maps portal**, specifically to collect user textual reviews for a given location. These reviews are valuable for analyzing and identifying cultural ecosystem services provided by natural and urban areas.

> **Note**: The code provided is a general framework for web scraping that works in our enviroment, it may require adaptation to fit your specific environment or use case.

> **Note on Analysis**: For topic modelling, we used **BERTopic** and followed the standard workflow as described in its [official documentation](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/). Other statistical analyses performed in the paper also follow standard workflows, as outlined in the documentation of their respective libraries.
